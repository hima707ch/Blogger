My first web development project, created using Node js, Mongo DB, Javascript, CSS, and EJS. In this, you can create your account, sign in to it, create a post in your account/profile, and delete a post. This is successfully deployed on Heroku and connected to a cloud-based database on Mongo Atlas.
